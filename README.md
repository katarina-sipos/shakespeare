# Shakespeare
Shakespeare provides searching for synonyms, word definitions, sound-alikes, antonyms, rhymes and words having the same meaning of an input word.

You can search words either by typing or you can take a photo of a writen or printed word and a text recognition software will recognize the expression and the word will be automatically filled in the searchbar.

In addition to that, the app supports saving notes. This is made for storing ideas or drafts of paragraphs and thoughts that a writer does not want to later forget.
